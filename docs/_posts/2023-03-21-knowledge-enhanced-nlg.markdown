abstract = {Knowledge in NLP has been a rising trend especially after the advent of large-scale pre-trained models. Knowledge is critical to equip statistics-based models with common sense, logic and other external information. In this tutorial, we will introduce recent state-of-the-art works in applying knowledge in language understanding, language generation and commonsense reasoning.},
