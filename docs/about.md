We are a mixture of Undergraduate / Postgraduate students based in HKUST that are
interested in recent AI advancements. We try to read papers that has wide impact;
therefore, we will select from top-tier AI / ML conferences and preferrably ones
that are not domain-specific.

### Why Red Fruit?

It's a simple word play. We are all Korean students from HKUST (香港科技大学, 홍콩과학기술대학),
which is often shortened to "홍과대" (香科大) in Korea. Here, "홍과" has the same
sound as "紅果" in Korean, which can directly be translated to "Red Fruit".
